# Dorna 2 Python API
This is the Python API tutorial for [Dorna][dorna] robotic arm.

## Setup
Notice that the program has been tested only on Python 3.7+.

### Repository
You can find the code repositry on [GitHub](https://github.com/dorna-robotics/dorna2-python), and report your technical issues [there](https://github.com/dorna-robotics/dorna2-python/issues).

### Download
First, use `git clone` to download the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dorna-robotics/dorna2-python.git
```
Or simply download the [zip file](https://github.com/dorna-robotics/dorna2-python/archive/master.zip), and uncompress the file.  

### Install
Next, go to the downloaded directory, where the `setup.py` file is located, and run:
```bash
python setup.py install --force
```
Notice that, on UNIX systems you need to use `sudo` prefix for admin previliages and installing the requirements:
```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install --force
```

### Getting Started
First, import `Dorna` class from the `dorna2` module, and then create a `Dorna` object.
``` python
from dorna2 import Dorna

# create the Dorna object
robot = Dorna()
```  

## Connection
The robot websocket server runs on `ws://robot_host_address:443`, where `robot_host_address` is the host address (IP) of the robot controller, and `443` is the port number. Once the connection has been established between the robot and the client (user), they start communicating with each other by sending and receiving data in [JSON][json] format. 

### `.connect(host="localhost", port=443, handshake_timeout=5)` 
Connect to the robot controller server at `ws://host:port`, and returns `True` on a successful connection, otherwise `False`.

#### Parameter
- *host*: (string) The controller host address. The default value is `"localhost"`.
- *port*: (int) The controller port number. The default value is `443`.
- *handshake_timeout*: (float > 0) Wait maximum of `handshake_timeout` seconds to establish a connection to the robot controller. The default value is `5` seconds.

> The `host` (string) and `port` (integer) arguments are similar to the Python `socket.connect((host, port))` method.

### `.close()` 
Use this method to close an opened connection. This method instantly closes the socket and terminates the communication loop. After this the `Dorna` object is unable to send or receive any message from (to) the controller server.  

> It is required to close an open connection when your task is over and the connection is no longer required.  

``` python
from dorna2 import Dorna

robot = Dorna()
robot.connect("10.0.0.10") # connect to the robot server at ws://10.0.0.10:443

# your code

robot.close() # always close the socket when you are done
``` 

## Send and Receive Data
Once you are  connected to the robot controller, you can start sending valid commands to the robot, and receive messages from it.   

### Command Status and Execution
We need to first get familiar with the status of a command. When sending a valid command to the robot, the controller reports the status of the command from the time that the command is submitted, to the time that the execution of that command is completed using a `stat` key and the unique `id` send initially with the command. An example of such a message is as follows:
``` python
# send a command to read the alarm status of the system
{"cmd":"alarm","id":10}

# receive the following messages one by one from the controller
{"id":10,"stat":0}
{"id":10,"stat":1}
{"cmd":"alarm","id":10,"alarm":0}
{"id":10,"stat":2}
```
#### ID Key
As you can see in the above example, we sent a command to the robot controller to get the alarm status of the robot. 
The robot replies back by sending multiple messages. Our initial command had an `id` field equal to `10`. So, any messages from the robot related to this command has the same `id` value.  

#### Stat Key
Another important key in the replies is the `stat` key. The `stat` field can take different values with the following interpretations:
- `stat = 0`: The command has been received by the controller with no error.
- `stat = 1`: The command execution has begun.
- `stat = 2`: The execution of the command is now completed, with no error.
- `stat < 0`: An error happened during the execution of the command and it will not be executed.

> Notice, that we say that a command is completed if get `stat = 2` or `stat < 0` of that command.

### `timeout` variable
Throughout this document we use and refer to the `timeout` key as an arguments inside methods that are sending command to the robot.  
Functions that are sending command to the robot are using the `timeout` argument for tracking the completion or any error during the execution of the command that they are sending. 
- `timeout < 0`: Send a command and wait for the command to get done ( `stat = 2` or `stat < 0`) and then return. At this moment we are sure that the command is no longer running.
- `timeout >= 0`: Send a command and wait for A maximum of `timeout` seconds for its execution. Notice that in this case, we might have returned from the function but the command which was sent by the fuction to the robot is still runnning or wating inside the controller for its time to run. If we do not want to wait for the execution of a command at all we can always set `timeout = 0`.

### `.play(timeout=-1, msg=None, **kwargs):`  
Send a message to the robot, and return `.track()`.  
There are multiple ways to send a message via `.play()`. For a better understanding, we send a simple `alarm` status command in three different ways:
- **Case 1:** (*Recommended*) Key and value format: `play(cmd='alarm', id=10})`
- **Case 2:** Python dictionary format: `play({'cmd': 'alarm', 'id': 10})` 
- **Case 3:** JSON string format: `play('{"cmd": "alarm", "id": 10}')`

#### Parameter
- *timeout*: (float) Throughout this document we use and refer to the `timeout` key as an arguments inside methods that are sending command to the robot. Use the `timeout` argument for tracking the completion or any error during the execution of the command.
    - `timeout < 0`: Send a command and wait for the command completion ( `stat = 2` or `stat < 0`) and then exit the function and  return. At this moment we are sure that the command is no longer running.
    - `timeout >= 0`: Send a command and wait for A maximum of `timeout` seconds for its completion. Notice that in this case, we might have returned from the function but the command is still running or waiting inside the controller queue for its time to run. If we do not want to wait for the execution of a command at all we can always set `timeout = 0`.

- *msg*: (Python dictionary or JSON string) Use this parameter if you want to send your command in a Python dictionary format (**Case 2**), or in a JSON format (**Case 3**).
- *kwargs*: Use this to send your command in a key and value format (**Case 1**).

> Notice that the `.play()` method always include a random `id` filed to your command if it is not present.

#### Usage
For better understanding of the `timeout` parameter, we send a joint move command to the robot.
``` python
# motion 1
start = time.time()
robot.play(timeout=-1, cmd="jmove", rel=1, j0=10, vel=1)
print(f"Motion 1 is completed, and took {time.time()-start} seconds.")

# motion 2
start = time.time()
robot.play(timeout=100, cmd="jmove", rel=1, j0=10, vel=1)
print(f"Motion 2 is completed, and took {time.time()-start} seconds.")

# motion 3
robot.play(timeout=2, cmd="jmove", rel=1, j0=10, vel=1)
print("2 second has passed and motion 3 is still running.")

# motion 4
robot.play(timeout=0, cmd="jmove", rel=1, j0=10, vel=1)
print("Motion 3 is still running and motion 4 is waiting for its execution.")

# Output:
#
#     The motion is completed
#     Motion 1 is completed, and took 10.199519157409668 seconds.
#     Motion 2 is completed, and took 10.207868814468384 seconds.
#     2 second has passed and motion 3 is still running.
#     Motion 3 is still running and motion 4 is waiting for its execution.
```


### `play_script(script_path, timeout=0)`
Send all the messages that are stored in a script file to the robot controller. The method opens the script file located at `script_path`, read the file line by line and send each line as a command.  
The function returns the number of commands which was sent to the robot controller.  
> Use this function to send multiple messages at once to the robot.
> Notice that each message has to occupy exactly one line. Multiple messages in one line or one message in multiple line is not a valid format. As an example, here we show a valid and invalid script format:
``` python
# valid format: Each message occupy exactly one line
{"cmd":"jmove","rel":0,"j0":0}
{"cmd":"jmove","rel":0,"j0":10}
{"cmd":"jmove","rel":0,"j0":-10}

# invalid format: Multiple commands in one line or one command in multiple line
{"cmd":"jmove","rel":0,"j0":0}{"cmd":"jmove","rel":0,"j0":10}
{"cmd":"jmove","rel":0,
"j0":-10}
``` 
#### Parameter
- *script_path*: (string) The path to the script file. 
- *timeout*: (float) Similar to the `timeout` parameter of the `.play()` method. The default value is `0`, which means that the function just sends the commands in the script file and return.

## Move
In this section we cover functions which are used for the robot motion. 

### `.jmove(**kwargs)`
A helper function to send a joint move (`jmove`) command, and return a `.track()` object associated to the `jmove` command sent.  
This method is basically similar to the [`.play()`](#???) method but the `cmd` key is set to `"jmove"`. So, `jmove(rel=1, j0=10, id=10)` is equivalent to `play(cmd='jmove', rel=1, j0=10, id=10)`.

### `.lmove(**kwargs)`
A helper function to send a line move (`lmove`) command, and return a `.track()` object associated to the `lmove` command sent.  
This method is basically similar to the [`.play()`](#???) method but the `cmd` key is set to `"lmove"`. So, `lmove(rel=1, x=10, id=10)` is equivalent to `play(cmd='lmove', rel=1, x=10, id=10)`.

### `.cmove(**kwargs)`
A helper function to send a circle move (`cmove`) command, and return a `.track()` object associated to the `cmove` command sent.

``` 

### Sleep
Send a `sleep` command to the controller and sleep for certain amount of time.

#### Usage
- `.sleep(val)`: Sleep for `val` (float >=0) seconds and return the status of the command. A successful sleep returns `2`. A negative integer return means that there was an error during the execution of this command.
